If your Base URL differs, replace all instances of /ombi with /YourBaseURL . If you're using a subdomain (ombi.example.com), replace all instances of /ombi with / , and remove the first location block. v4 Reverse Proxy Nginx \u00b6 To use nginx as a reverse proxy requires no extra modules, but it does require configuring. In the configuration for your nginx site (nginx.conf for the default site), you'll need to add a 'block' for catching ombi as a subpath. If you wish to use a subdomain, there is an example further down . It goes directly below the default location, which usually looks like this: location / { root html; index index.html index.htm; } The block to add looks like this (some changes can be made depending on your setup, but generally this works). Note that if the machine hosting your application is not the same as your web server, then you'll need to replace \"127.0.0.1\" with the IP of your Ombi host. Nginx is smart enough to match the \"ombi\" in your location to the \"ombi\" in your BaseURL. location / ombi / { proxy_pass http : // 127.0.0.1 : 5000 ; proxy_set_header Host $host ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $server_name ; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Ssl on ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme ; proxy_read_timeout 90 ; proxy_redirect http : // 127.0.0.1 : 5000 https :// $ host ; } nginx with Subdomain \u00b6 If you wish to use ombi.example.com rather than example.com/ombi, then you need to create a site per service. You will also need to ensure that ombi is not configured to use a BaseURL. Each site has a separate config file in the sites-available directory. By default, this is /etc/nginx/sites-available . We're going to use the site name as the file name, so in this case we need to put the following into /etc/nginx/sites-available/ombi.example.com.conf Note that this example does not enable SSL or generate a certificate, but that can be done afterwards using a tool like Certbot. Certbot will add the listen 443 , generate, and apply the certificates using LetsEncrypt. Of course, replace 127.0.0.1 : 5000 with whatever IP and port combination you are using for Ombi. Ensure your Application Url (in Ombi) matches the server_name field. server { listen 80 ; listen [ :: ] : 80 ; server_name ombi.example.com ; location / { proxy_pass http : // 127.0.0.1 : 5000 / ; } } Disable support for Websockets. Disable these items by commenting them out: # Allow websockets on all servers #proxy_http_version 1.1; #proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; #proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\"; Once the config file has been created ( and saved ), we need to enable the site. This is done by symlinking the config file into the sites-enabled directory. The below commands will achieve this (obviously, replace the ombi.example.com sections with whatever names you used for your setup. Linux: ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/ombi.example.com.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ombi.example.com.conf Windows: mklink C:\\nginx\\conf\\sites-enabled\\ombi.example.com.conf C:\\nginx\\conf\\sites-available\\ombi.example.com.conf We then restart nginx to load the new config file, at which point your system will be listening on http://ombi.example.com for traffic (after you set up certbot, it will change to https://ombi.example.com ). Linux: service nginx restart Windows: nginx - s reload Apache \u00b6 To run Apache with a reverse proxy setup, you'll need to activate certain modules. Ubuntu 18.04 \u00b6 Note: assume all commands require sudo. apt-get install -y libapache2-mod-proxy-html libxml2-dev a2enmod proxy a2enmod proxy_http a2enmod proxy_ajp a2enmod rewrite a2enmod deflate a2enmod headers a2enmod proxy_balancer a2enmod proxy_connect a2enmod proxy_html In your Virtualhost configuration file you'll need to add a few things. Note: VirtualHost configurations are usually under /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ Just below the DocumentRoot entry: ProxyPreserveHost On You can then add the configuration for each item you wish to proxy. There are two methods for doing this. One is with a 'Location' section, the other is simply a direct mapping (the dirty way). The mapping goes just before the </VirtualHost> closing tag, regardless of the method. If you want to run ombi.example.com instead of site.example.com/ombi, then replace /ombi with / and drop the /ombi from the end of the internal addresses, as well as removing the BaseURL from Ombi itself. Location \u00b6 <Location /ombi > Allow from 0.0.0.0 ProxyPass \"http://ip.of.ombi.host:5000/ombi\" connectiontimeout=5 timeout=30 keepalive=on ProxyPassReverse \"http://ip.of.ombi.host:5000/ombi\" </Location> Direct Mapping \u00b6 ProxyPass /ombi http://ip.of.ombi.host:5000/ombi ProxyPassReverse /ombi http://ip.of.ombi.host:5000/ombi Once all your changes are done, you'll need to run service apache2 restart to make the changes go live. IIS \u00b6 NOTE: There are some extra steps involved with getting IIS to proxy things. Install these two modules: URL Rewrite Application Request Routing After installing the above, enable the proxy function via: IIS admin -> Application Request Routing Cache -> Server Proxy Settings, tick \"Enable proxy\" IIS With Subfolder \u00b6 NOTE1: Below rules assume you have a \"virtual directory\" named \"OMBI\" under your default website in IIS. That VD should target a physical directory that resides at c:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\ombi . Within this directory you would place the below rules in a web.config file.

You can find Caddy here , and their docs can be found here . An official docker image can be found here . Otherwise you can direct install using a binary found here . Note: The official binaries and Docker image do not include any of the DNS plugins required for wildcard certificates or DNS verification instead of port 80 verification. If your connection blocks port 80, you will need to build your own binary or image to include these.

Any requests made without an endpoint to receive it will not be able to be re-processed at this point. Whatever combination of the supported systems you use is up to you - Sonarr, Radarr, Couchpotato, Lidarr... Whatever. For a guide on updating, see Update Settings For considerations when migrating an existing install rather than starting fresh, see Migrating Systems Recommended install workflow \u00b6 Install Ombi for your preferred OS using the steps provided below. If you are migrating systems, rather than starting fresh, stop here and look at Migrating Systems . Configure your install-specific settings like the application url you'll be using externally. Configure external access to Ombi. We recommend using SSL and a reverse proxy . Configure notification methods and system connections (Sonarr, Radarr, etc). Ensure you have systems to handle approved requests before you give users access to the system. Import users and assign permissions . Migrating Systems \u00b6 If you're migrating Ombi from an existing install to a new install, the install process itself is exactly the same as below - with one exception, regardless of what you're migrating from or to. Depending on what database you're using, you will need to keep the following files: SQLite Ombi.db OmbiExternal.db OmbiSettings.db MySQL database.json When it comes time to actually launch Ombi on your fresh installation, place the relevant files into the new Ombi directory (wherever you may have put it), and then launch Ombi. This way Ombi will load with all of your prior settings, customisations, users, and synced data (so it doesn't require a full re-sync with Plex). If you are running docker, place these files into the folder you've passed into the container as \"/config\" for the installation to find them.

DO NOT place in the \"Program Files\" or \"ProgramData\" folders as the Ombi database will be locked. Use NSSM to manage Ombi. Extract either the 32-/64-bit version to C:\\Windows\\system32 . Open command prompt as an Administrator and type nssm install Ombi . Use one of the following settings depending on whether you want to keep or change the default port. Standard Setup Be sure to adjust directories to your Ombi install location Path: C:\\Tools\\Ombi\\Ombi.exe Start directory: C:\\Tools\\Ombi Alternate port number Be sure to adjust directories to your Ombi install location Path: C:\\Tools\\Ombi\\Ombi.exe Start directory: C:\\Tools\\Ombi Arguments: --host \"http://*:PORTNUMBER\" Install as a scheduled task \u00b6 As an alternative to NSSM, you can use Task Scheduler to run Ombi.exe as if you were double clicking it and running it like a regular executable, except it's hidden from the task bar and can only be closed by the Task Manager or the Task Scheduler. Open 'Task Scheduler' either search for it in start. Or simply Run... Win + R %windir % \\ system32 \\ taskschd . msc Click Create task... on the right hand side. Give the task a name.

Please enter your credentials and click OK Click Task Scheduler Library right click on your new task and hit run. give it a good 20-30 seconds to start. Ombi should now be reachable at http://localhost:5000 ! Note: The next time you restart your PC, Task Scheduler will run ombi for you. Scheduled task (with pictures) \u00b6 How to WITH PICTURES! Windows Firewall \u00b6 To allow a port through Windows Firewall, you have a few options. Note that this is not the preferred method of access, and a Reverse Proxy is recommended instead. Replace the port in the below commands with your own port if you're running a different port than the default. Command Prompt netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name= \"Ombi\" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=5000 Powershell New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName 'Ombi' -Direction Inbound -Action Allow -Protocol TCP -LocalPort @( '5000' ) Linux systems \u00b6 Debian / APT repo \u00b6 Note: This is the easy way, and only works with Debian-based distributions.

If there is an error you can contact in Discord or you can open an incident here . 1. Requirements \u00b6 Python3 Ombi version 4.0.728 or higher 2. Download Script and install dependencies \u00b6 Download the script. git clone https://github.com/vsc55/ombi_sqlite_mysql.git ombi_sqlite_mysql cd ombi_sqlite_mysql chmod +x *.py Install the dependencies according to the operating system we use. apt-get install python-mysqldb # Debian/Ubuntu emerge -va mysqlclient # Gentoo pip install mysqlclient # Python Pip python -m pip install mysqlclient # Python Pip 3.

To be able to use multiple servers or databases we will need to manually edit database.json . The example below will export the \"OmbiDatabase\" and \"SettingsDatabase\" databases to the server at \"192.168.0.100\" (but to different databases on the same server), while the \"ExternalDatabase\" database will be sent to server \"192.168.1.200\" . { \"OmbiDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=192.168.1.100;Port=3306;Database=Ombi;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" }, \"SettingsDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=192.168.1.100;Port=3306;Database=Ombi_Settings;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" }, \"ExternalDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=192.168.1.200;Port=3306;Database=Ombi_External;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" } } Run the following command: ombi --migrate 4. Data Migration \u00b6 When it comes to migrating the data, we have several different ways of doing it. We can export everything to a single database (step 4.1), to different databases or to different mysql servers (step 4.2). 4.1. Data Migration ( Single Database ) \u00b6 For data migration we will need the file \"migration.json\" that contains the locations of the SQLite databases. If this file does not exist, it will be created and will search the databases in the folder specified with the parameter \"--config\" . If we don't want to migrate all the data, we can generate the file \"migration.json\" with the parameter \"--only_manager_json\" and then edit it by deleting the databases we don't want to migrate. 4.1.1 Exclude OmbiExternal from export (optional) \u00b6 $ python ombi_sqlite2mysql.py -c /etc/Ombi --only_manager_json Migration tool from SQLite to MySql/MariaDB for ombi ( 3 .0.4 ) By VSC55 Generate file \"migration.json\" : - Saving in ( /etc/Ombi/migration.json ) ...

[ \u2713 ] Start ombi and test if everything works fine. 4.2. Data Migration ( Multiple DataBases or Servers MySql/MariaDB ) \u00b6 For data migration to multiple databases or servers we will need the file \"database_multi.json\" that contains the locations of the servers where we are going to export the data. To create the file \"database_multi.json\" we will use the file \"database.json\" so we will only have to rename it. $ vi da ta base_mul t i.jso n { \"OmbiDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=192.168.1.100;Port=3306;Database=Ombi;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" }, \"SettingsDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=192.168.1.100;Port=3306;Database=Ombi_Settings;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" }, \"ExternalDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=192.168.1.200;Port=3306;Database=Ombi_External;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" } } We can omit the export of a database by removing it from \"database_multi.json\" or adding the property \"Skip\" . The example next will export the databases \"OmbiDatabase\" and \"SettingsDatabase\" but omit \"ExternalDatabase\" . $ vi da ta base_mul t i.jso n { \"OmbiDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=192.168.1.100;Port=3306;Database=Ombi;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" }, \"SettingsDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=192.168.1.100;Port=3306;Database=Ombi_Settings;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" }, \"ExternalDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=192.168.1.200;Port=3306;Database=Ombi_External;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" , \"Skip\" : true } } We can also send the same database to different servers with the following configuration. The next example sends databases \"OmbiDatabase\", \"SettingsDatabase\" and \"ExternalDatabase\" to servers 192.168.1.100 and 192.168.1.200. $ vi da ta base_mul t i.jso n { \"OmbiDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=192.168.1.100;Port=3306;Database=Ombi;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" }, \"SettingsDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=192.168.1.100;Port=3306;Database=Ombi_Settings;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" }, \"ExternalDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=192.168.1.100;Port=3306;Database=Ombi_External;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" }, \"OmbiDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=192.168.1.200;Port=3306;Database=Ombi;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" }, \"SettingsDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=192.168.1.200;Port=3306;Database=Ombi_Settings;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" }, \"ExternalDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=192.168.1.200;Port=3306;Database=Ombi_External;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" } } NOTE: If you want to export all the content to several servers we will have to repeat the point \"Create and prepare tables\" with the different servers so that all the tables are created. You will also have to modify the file database.json at the end of the export process before running ombi to leave a single server for each database.

Watchtower (Docker) \u00b6 There is an option in docker to use something called ' Watchtower ' to automatically update containers/images. If going this route we strongly suggest using a few extra arguments for both the Ombi container and the watchtower one. For the Ombi container, add a label to the container named com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable . Set it to true .

The way this works is that Ombi looks for a database.json file in the installation directory (or, if you specified a Storage Path at startup, in that location e.g. AppData). If the file is not found then Ombi falls back to the default, creating or using existing SQLite databases in the Ombi directory. database.json \u00b6 The database.json file needs to look like the below example (replacing usernames, passwords, and server addresses to match your own mysql server as needed). { \"OmbiDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=192.168.1.7;Port=3306;Database=Ombi;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" }, \"SettingsDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"sqlite\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Data Source=C:/tmp/Settings.db\" }, \"ExternalDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"sqlite\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Data Source=C:/tmp/External.db\" } } As you can see you can specify a database type and a connectionstring per database that Ombi has. You can see what each database is used for here . Supported Databases \u00b6 Type ConnectionString Example SQLite Data Source=C:/tmp/Ombi.db MySQL/MariaDB Server=localhost;Database=Ombi;User=root;Password=123456; SQLite \u00b6 The default. This requires no database.json file, and checks for the relevant db files in the application directory. MySql/MariaDB \u00b6 Supported versions: https://github.com/PomeloFoundation/Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql#supported-dbms-and-versions Please ensure that your database character set is set to utf8mb4 . You can check your db charset by running the following query: show variables like 'character_set_database' ; You can use a separate database per function (like sqlite does, with the 3 db files), or point all of them at the same mysql database, as each table has a unique name regardless. It is up to you whether you use separate databases for each. For people unfamiliar with mysql, it is much easier to drop a database than to drop specific tables. Single Database \u00b6 This example shows using a single mysql \"ombi\" database for all 'sub' databases (tables). { \"OmbiDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=localhost;Port=3306;Database=Ombi;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" }, \"SettingsDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=localhost;Port=3306;Database=Ombi;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" }, \"ExternalDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=localhost;Port=3306;Database=Ombi;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" } } Multiple Databases \u00b6 This example shows using a separate mysql database for each 'sub' database (tables). { \"OmbiDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=localhost;Port=3306;Database=Ombi;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" }, \"SettingsDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=localhost;Port=3306;Database=Ombi_Settings;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" }, \"ExternalDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=localhost;Port=3306;Database=Ombi_External;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" } } Create database and user \u00b6 On the MySQL/MariaDB server we will create the database and the user that we will use later. You need to GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES for every database you create. This is done in the mysql console (or phpmyadmin if you have that configured). Single Database permissions \u00b6 CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `Ombi` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_bin ; CREATE USER 'ombi' @'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'ombi' ; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `Ombi` . * TO 'ombi' @'%' WITH GRANT OPTION ; Multiple Database permissions \u00b6 CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `Ombi` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_bin ; CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `Ombi_Settings` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_bin ; CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `Ombi_External` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_bin ; CREATE USER 'ombi' @'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'ombi' ; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `Ombi` . * TO 'ombi' @'%' WITH GRANT OPTION ; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `Ombi_Settings` . * TO 'ombi' @'%' WITH GRANT OPTION ; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `Ombi_External` . * TO 'ombi' @'%' WITH GRANT OPTION ; Functionality \u00b6 So long as: database.json exists The details within it are correct The database(s) exist The user(s) exist Restarting ombi should generate the tables and start up ombi like it would normally. This will not migrate any existing settings. You effectively have a clean ombi install. Migration \u00b6 You can migrate the existing sqlite databases to mysql if you choose by following the Migration Guide Installing MySQL on Windows \u00b6 For installing MySQL we need to install the MySQL Community Server. You can download it here . Download \u00b6 Hit the \"Go to Download Page\" button and click on the bottom \"Download\" button. This is the offline installer, the top one is the web installer. After clicking you will be presented with a new page asking you to login or sign up. Do whatever you like here, but make sure you've also seen the \"No thanks, just start my download.\" on the bottom left. Install \u00b6 When the download is complete, run the installer and follow the steps below: Choose a Setup Type Make sure Custom is selected and click Next. Select Products and Features Select the following products to install: MySQL Server MySQL Workbench Click on next to continue. Installation It could give you a message that some requirements are missing. This is fine, since it will install those requirements. Click Execute. When the installation is finished, click on next. Configure \u00b6 Click Next. High Availability \u00b6 Make sure the Standalone MySQL Server is selected and click Next. Type and Networking \u00b6 You now see the default settings. Nothing needs to be changed , but you can change the port if needed. Make sure that you don't forget the port number in the database.json when you are going to migrate! Click Next. Authentication Method \u00b6 We need to change the default setting to \"Use Legacy Authentication Method\". Since this is a security risk I would advise closing the port (3306 default) in your modem. Account and Roles \u00b6 We need to set a root password which allows us to connect to MySQL Server. This password is important, as it is needed for creating databases and potential future maintenance on it. Because of this, make sure you don't forget the password! We don't need to create users here - that's done in the migration process above. Windows Service \u00b6 You can keep the default settings here and click on Next. Apply Configuration \u00b6 Now it is time to actually apply all the configuration we just set. Hit Execute. Once it is done, hit Finish. Using MySQL Workbench \u00b6 In order to run the sql commands above, you'll need to use MySQL workbench. Hit start and type MySQL Workbench. Run the application. Click on the grey block which is named: \"Local Instance\". It will pop-up a box to enter your root password which you set in the installation of MySQL Server. Once you have entered the root password it will ask if you wanna store your password in the vault. I would recommend to do so, so you don't need to enter your root password again when you connect. You can now see the workbench which is displaying your MySQL server. Enter the queries/commands you wish to run into the query editor on screen, then click on the Lightning Bolt above the code to execute them. We are done with MySQL Server and the MySQL workbench. One quick tip is that on the left side (where you found Users and Privileges) there is a Dashboard.

Most of the time, you can freely edit the listings on TVMAZE and the theTVDB to have the information needed to make an item available.

Docker Issues \u00b6 If you're running all your services in containers, be mindful that sometimes NAT is a fickle mistress for those who fiddle. If you have services behind a reverse proxy, use the full external address for the service. If you have them behind Organizr as well, then use the Docker IP and port of each container instead - to avoid any routing or authentication issues that this can cause. If you use the host IP instead of the container IP, be sure to use the local port you mapped to the container, rather than simply the container port (these are not always the same).

There are things to consider when doing this - primarily, how are your containers going to communicate with each other/other machines? Installation \u00b6 Direct Command \u00b6 If you just want Ombi to run, it's entirely possible to do this without having to do much actual configuration. You'll (ideally) need a location mounted for Ombi to put config files ( /opt/ombi/config/ tends to be a good option on linux based systems). To create the folder and run Ombi on port 3579 (the default for v4), run the following from the terminal/shell: mkdir -p /opt/ombi/config/ docker run -d --name = ombi -p 5000 :5000 --restart = unless-stopped -v /opt/ombi/config:/config linuxserver/ombi:latest This will create the folder and a container named \"ombi\" that you can then manage like any other docker container. If you wish to use mysql as a database for ombi, then you'll need to create a \"database.json\" file in the config folder created before. Details for the file can be found here . Docker Compose \u00b6 Here an example of a docker-compose stack with Ombi, MySQL and phpMyAdmin. Please bear in mind that this is just an example and can/should be changed to your needs: Create a folder for your \"/config\"-volume and for the MySQL-container mkdir -p /opt/ombi/config/ mkdir -p /opt/ombi/mysql/ Create a \"database.json\"-file in the folder from step 1 with this content \u2192 see here : { \"OmbiDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=mysql_db;Port=3306;Database=Ombi;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" }, \"SettingsDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=mysql_db;Port=3306;Database=Ombi_Settings;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" }, \"ExternalDatabase\" : { \"Type\" : \"MySQL\" , \"ConnectionString\" : \"Server=mysql_db;Port=3306;Database=Ombi_External;User=ombi;Password=ombi\" } } Create a \"docker-compose.yml\" file in the folder from step 1 with this content: (replace the TZ value with your timezone) --- version : \"3\" services : ombi : image : ghcr . io / linuxserver / ombi : latest container_name : ombi restart : unless - stopped environment : - PUID = 1000 - PGID = 1000 - TZ = Europe / Zurich volumes : - / opt / ombi / config : / config ports : - \"5000:3579\" depends_on : - \"mysql_db\" mysql_db : image : \"mysql:5.7\" container_name : ombi_mysql restart : unless - stopped environment : MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD : 123 #change your root password here volumes : - / opt / ombi / mysql : / var / lib / mysql phpmyadmin : image : phpmyadmin / phpmyadmin container_name : ombi_phpmyadmin restart : unless - stopped environment : PMA_HOST : mysql_db ports : - '8080:80' depends_on : - \"mysql_db\" Run docker-compose to start this stack cd /opt/ombi/config docker-compose up -d Open the phpMyadmin website \"http://docker-host-ip:8080/server_sql.php\".

Considerations \u00b6 Host vs Bridge Networking \u00b6 Host \u00b6 Host networking gives the container direct access to the network adapter of the host machine (the one running Docker). This means that the container runs like any other network application, with complete freedom to discover other devices/services on your network. It is appropriate for some systems (like Home Assistant), but one of the benefits of Docker is the 'isolation' of services (so nothing depends on anything else). Bridge \u00b6 Bridge networking makes the Docker Host behave like a VM Host and a router, with a whole separate virtual network behind its own LAN IP. Each container then gets an IP in a whole different IP range than your LAN itself. Usually, Docker uses 172.17.0.x for these. If the Ombi container was given 172.17.0.3, then it would listen on 172.17.0.3:5000 (for example). This means that you map ports from the host to the container , much like port forwarding for access from outside your network (as you would for passing ports 80 and 443 to your web server, for instance). The two ports do not have to be the same - you could map 3589 on your host to point to 3579 on your container . To access the service from outside of the Docker host , you'd browse to the LAN IP of said host and the port you mapped - 3589 in the example above. Docker would see the traffic hit the host on 3589 and pass it through (via Network Address Translation, or 'NAT') to the container on 172.17.0.3:5000 Talking to Other Services \u00b6 If you have an Ombi container, and a Sonarr container (or Radarr/Lidarr/CouchPotato etc), then these services will all need to talk to each other. If you've configured your containers to use host networking, then all you'll need to do is use the LAN IP of the Docker host as the IP of the service. However, if you've used bridge , then you can use either the container IP or the container name instead (as this stays inside the virtual network that the host created for all the containers to communicate via). For example, if you have a Sonarr container named \"sonarr\" that has an IP of 172.17.0.17, then you could either enter \"sonarr\" or \"172.17.0.17\" as the address for Ombi to reach Sonarr. Finding Container IP addresses \u00b6 If you want to get the container IP, then you'll need to query docker for it. Most GUI options for Docker will report it (Portainer is a good one). If you prefer the CLI/console/bash/shell, then you can inspect the container that way with the below command: docker inspect <container name> | grep \"IPAddress\" If you don't recall what name you used for the container, then you can find out your container names with: docker container ps","title":"Docker Containers"},{"location":"info/docker-containers/#docker-intro","text":"If you're running Ombi in a Docker container, then chances are you're running other services in one as well.

See also: Known Faults , Common Errors How do I request a feature be added to Ombi \u00b6 See Feature Suggestions What is the Plex connection used for \u00b6 1) It allows for using oAuth sign-in (so users don't have to add another password to the mix). 1) It allows for checking for actual availability (not just in place according to *arr, but indexed in a library and actually watchable). 1) It allows for Ombi to use a plex ID for the link in newsletters etc - so users can click the notification and be taken directly to the item in Plex. Can I synchronise users between Ombi and Tautulli? \u00b6 Yes, you can. This is a little more involved than some people are comfortable with, as it's not officially supported. If that doesn't worry you, and you're comfortable with running custom scripts and Python code, then you can check out the script created by DirtyCajunRice here . How do I get the QR code for mobile connections? \u00b6 Ensure that the application URL has been entered. Database uses \u00b6 There are 3 databases that Ombi uses. Ombi This contains Ombi specific information e.g. Users, Requests, Issues OmbiExternal This contains the information we take from external providers e.g. Plex Server Content, Radarr Content, Sonarr Content OmbiSettings This contains all of the settings that you have applied to Ombi e.g. Notification Preferences, SMTP Settings, Sonarr Settings, Plex Settings How can I include Ombi logs in Logarr? \u00b6 Because Ombi adds the date into the name of the log file, you can't hard-code to the latest log file - the link will be incorrect the next day. Instead, we can use the php date() function and string concatenation (.) to build the path on the fly when we are in Logarr. The logs are named in the format log-yyyymmdd.txt - so January 14, 2019 would be log-20190114.txt . php date(Ymd) gives us the date in that format, and we can concatenate it into our ombi log path in Logarr configs like so: ( Note : change folder paths to match your own install directory of Ombi.) \"Ombi\" => 'C:\\Services\\Ombi\\Logs\\log-' . date(\"Ymd\") . '.txt', You can also use similar code for any software which hard-codes the date into the config. It's not uncommon. Can I force requests to re-add to client systems? \u00b6 Some people make the mistake of letting users request content before they configure the client systems to receive the requests (Sonarr/Radarr/CouchPotato/SickRage/Lidarr etc). To force Ombi to attempt to re-process the request (and send it to the relevant system): The UI Way Open Ombi. Click \"Requests\" (left hand menu). Find the relevant request in the lists. Click \"Details\". Click the little gear icon (top right). Click \"Re-Process Request\". The SQL way (unsupported) In older versions of Ombi, there was no way to force the software to 're-add' the requested item to the downloader/monitoring system. To achieve this, you would need to open the Ombi.db file and execute commands on it manually (Ombi will need to be stopped for this to work), marking the relevant requests as \"needs approval\" via an SQL command. This would allow you to then click \"approve\" and have Ombi add the request to the relevant application and continue as normal. Note: this is not supported officially and carries risks. The relevant commands are: UPDATE AlbumRequests SET Approved = 0 WHERE Approved = 1 AND Available = 0 ; UPDATE ChildRequests SET Approved = 0 WHERE Approved = 1 AND Available = 0 ; UPDATE EpisodeRequests SET Approved = 0 WHERE Approved = 1 AND Available = 0 ; UPDATE MovieRequests SET Approved = 0 WHERE Approved = 1 AND Available = 0 ; TV shows and episodes not showing as available \u00b6 The most common reason for this is that we require TVDB information to match against, and your TV library in Plex probably doesn't have this metadata information. To fix this you need to ensure your TV Library in Plex is using an agent that provides this ID. We suggest \"TheTVDB\". Edit Library > Advanced > Agent = TheTVDB Refresh the metadata for that library, and next time the Plex Sync job runs it should pick up that the content now has TheTVDB Id's! Notifications are not sending, but mass email works \u00b6 Before any notifications will work properly you'll need to ensure you have configured your application URL under Settings -> Customization. This is due to Ombi needing to know where to send users if they click any links within the notifications. Notifications for requests not being received \u00b6 Check and test if you have configured the notification(s) as per instructions in Discord Notification Settings and Email Notification Settings If testing the notification(s) work fine then make sure that the user requesting is not an auto approve or admin user Ombi does not default to English or my preferred language \u00b6 Once you have set your preferred language in the user preferences area of Ombi, then it's attached to your user profile. When Ombi loads up, it checks what was set and will use that. If nothing has been set then Ombi sets whatever is the first language your browser presents to it. If this does not get presented properly, this is mostly an issue with Chrome. You can run the command navigator.languages in the Chrome console to see the list. To get Ombi to display the language you want, make that language appear as the first entry in the above command. You can do this by: Open the Chrome Language Settings page chrome://settings/languages Click the down arrow next to Language Click the 3 ellipses by the language you want to set as default Click move to the top.

We're going to use the site name as the file name, so in this case we need to put the following into /etc/nginx/sites-available/ombi.example.com.conf Note that this example does not enable SSL or generate a certificate, but that can be done afterwards using a tool like Certbot. Certbot will add the listen 443 , generate, and apply the certificates using LetsEncrypt. Of course, replace 127.0.0.1:5000 with whatever IP and port combination you are using for Ombi. Ensure your Application Url (in Ombi) matches the server_name field. # Ombi v4 Subdomain # Replace EXAMPLE.COM with your domain server { listen 80 ; server_name ombi .* ; return 301 https : //$ server_name $ request_uri ; } server { listen 443 ssl http2 ; server_name ombi .* ; server_name ombi .

This is done by symlinking the config file into the sites-enabled directory. The below commands will achieve this (obviously, replace the ombi.example.com sections with whatever names you used for your setup. Linux: ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/ombi.example.com.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ombi.example.com.conf Windows: mklink C:\\nginx\\conf\\sites-enabled\\ombi.example.com.conf C:\\nginx\\conf\\sites-available\\ombi.example.com.conf We then restart nginx to load the new config file, at which point your system will be listening on http://ombi.example.com for traffic (after you set up certbot, it will change to https://ombi.example.com ). Linux: service nginx restart Windows: nginx - s reload Apache2 \u00b6 To run Apache with a reverse proxy setup, you'll need to activate certain modules. (assume all commands require sudo): apt-get install -y libapache2-mod-proxy-html libxml2-dev a2enmod proxy a2enmod proxy_http a2enmod proxy_ajp a2enmod rewrite a2enmod deflate a2enmod headers a2enmod proxy_balancer a2enmod proxy_connect a2enmod proxy_html In your Virtualhost configuration file you'll need to add a few things. Note: VirtualHost configurations are usually under /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ Just below the DocumentRoot entry: ProxyPreserveHost On You can then add the configuration for each item you wish to proxy. There are two methods for doing this. One is with a 'Location' section, the other is simply a direct mapping (the dirty way). The mapping goes just before the </VirtualHost> closing tag, regardless of the method. If you want to run ombi.example.com instead of site.example.com/ombi, then replace /ombi with / and drop the /ombi from the end of the internal addresses, as well as removing the BaseURL from Ombi itself. Apache2 Subdirectory \u00b6 <Location /ombi > Allow from 0.0.0.0 ProxyPass \"http://ip.of.ombi.host:5000/ombi\" connectiontimeout=5 timeout=30 keepalive=on ProxyPassReverse \"http://ip.of.ombi.host:5000/ombi\" </Location> Apache2 Subdomain \u00b6 ProxyPass /ombi http://ip.of.ombi.host:5000/ombi ProxyPassReverse /ombi http://ip.of.ombi.host:5000/ombi Once all your changes are done, you'll need to run service apache2 restart to make the changes go live.

You can find Caddy here , and their docs can be found here . An official docker image can be found here . Otherwise you can direct install using a binary found here . Note: The official binaries and Docker image do not include any of the DNS plugins required for wildcard certificates or DNS verification instead of port 80 verification. If your connection blocks port 80, you will need to build your own binary or image to include these.

As an example address, assume we use a service behind a reverse proxy, with each service being accessible at the following addresses: Sonarr: https://app.example.com/sonarr Lidarr: https://app.example.com/lidarr Radarr: https://app.example.com/radarr Enabled \u00b6 This switch tells Ombi whether to use this service or not. Don't run the service? Don't enable it. V3 \u00b6 Sonarr recently made V3 their \"stable\" branch, meaning V2 is now 'legacy'. This option is now the default for new sites, and should only be disabled if you are running the legacy version. We do not recommend this. Scan for Availability \u00b6 This option will allow Ombi to sync with the Arrs to check for availability. If you have set up your Plex (or Emby) sync to detect what is available you won't have to use this. Hostname \u00b6 This is the address you use to connect to the service. If it's running on the same machine as Ombi, localhost usually works. If you're running the services (and Ombi itself) in docker containers, you could use the container IP . If the services are on multiple machines, IP addresses tend to be useful here. If, however, you use the service behind a reverse proxy , then the 'hostname' field is the bit from before the 'baseurl'. In the examples above, this would be app.example.com . Port \u00b6 If you're not using a reverse proxy, this is whatever port you use to access the service (it's the number after the second \":\" in the address bar). In the case of Sonarr, the default is 8989 . If you're using a reverse proxy without SSL, the port will be 80 (pro-tip: don't do that) . If you're running with SSL, the port will be 443 . SSL \u00b6 If you're running a reverse proxy with SSL, and are going through that address rather than the direct internal address, this needs to be enabled. Otherwise, leave it off. API key \u00b6 This is the API key for each relevant service. You can get this by looking under Settings -> General in each one. Base URL \u00b6 If you use a reverse proxy and have a baseurl configured in any of the services, you'll need to fill this in. This tends to be the thing you put in after the hostname to access the service - in the example above for Lidarr, this field would need to have /lidarr added to it. Quality Profiles \u00b6 Depending on the service, you may have this appear several times. There will be a button to 'get' these from the service. Click it, wait, and select one. If it doesn't work, save the settings and \"Test Connectivity\". You may not be able to communicate with the service yet. Root Folders \u00b6 Depending on the service, you may have this appear several times. There will be a button to 'get' these from the service. Click it, wait, and select one. If it doesn't work, save the settings and \"Test Connectivity\". You may not be able to communicate with the service yet. Submit \u00b6 This button is used to save and activate your new settings. This will not work if you have not filled in every option for the relevant service (folders, qualities, languages, seasons, albums, availability). Sonarr / Radarr \u00b6 Default Minimum Availability \u00b6 This tells Ombi what it should add movies to Radarr as - should it wait until they're available on disc to look for them, in theatres, announced...? To try to avoid picking up fakes, Physical/Web is your best option. Language Profile \u00b6 There will be a button to 'get' these from the service. Click it, wait, and select one. If it doesn't work, save the settings and \"Test Connectivity\". You may not be able to communicate with the service yet. Lidarr Specific \u00b6 Metadata Profile \u00b6 Lidarr uses these to say what it should pull in by an artist (compilations, mixtapes, albums, singles...). Again, 'get' the options from the service and select one. Album Folder \u00b6 This tells Ombi that Lidarr wants things organised into individual subfolders per album. Usually, this should be ticked. Sonarr Specific \u00b6 Enable Season Folders \u00b6 This tells Ombi that Sonarr wants things organised into Season subfolders. Usually, this should be ticked. Advanced \u00b6 Any setting behind advanced is not recommended to be altered, unless you know what you are doing. Do not search \u00b6 When a movie/series/album gets requested and approved, it will be added as unmonitored to the Arrs. This means it will not auto download.","title":"Radarr"},{"location":"settings/all-the-arrs/#all-the-arrs","text":"Under Settings -> Movies / TV / Music, you'll find the configuration sections for each of the following: Sonarr Radarr Lidarr Each one does a different thing, but they're all based on the same codebase - so their configurations are similar.

Application Url \u00b6 This is for any external links we send out (this link should be the externally accessible URL), usually in the form of an email. e.g. Password reset email - we use the Application URL to take them to a page where they can reset their password. This is also used to generate the QR code for mobile app connections. Format: http://ombi.example.com/ or http://ombi.example.com/ or https://example.com/ombi/ Custom Logo \u00b6 This is used for the Login Page, Landing Page and also any notifications that we send a logo e.g. Email Notifications. Format: http://url.to.picture/ Custom CSS \u00b6 There are two ways we officially support custom CSS . They are by import or direct entry. For some ideas, you can find some common customisations under Common Themes Any CSS you wish to use should be put into the Custom CSS box. It could be a reference to a CSS file (via an import reference) or could be raw CSS itself. Note: For CSS import to work, it requires a MIME type of text/css or the browser will not load it as a stylesheet. Custom Donation \u00b6 We have the ability to set a custom donation url and message, this will be displayed to all users unlike the ombi donation message. Use Custom Page \u00b6 This allows you to add a blank page to the Nav bar that you are able to fully customise the HTML with a WYSIWYG editor. Once you enable this setting, just refresh the page and you will see the new option in the navigation bar, from there you can edit your page. Note: You must add the Edit Custom Page Role to your user account before you are able to edit the Custom Page. This can be done via the User Management page. Disclaimer : The Custom Page is public and can be accessed without authorization, there are plans to add an authorization toggle to this page. Use the custom page with caution. Landing/Login Page Backgrounds \u00b6 We do have the ability to change what backgrounds are used on the landing and login pages. This is not done via the Ombi UI, but done in the appsettings.json file in the Ombi directory Example.

You are able to add/remove the Id's for the sections to change the background images. If you do not want any TV shows or Movies then leave that section as an empty array e.g. \"LandingPageBackground\" : { \"Movies\" : [ 278 , 244786 , 680 , 155 , 13 , 1891 , 399106 ], \"TvShows\" : [] } The above will only show movie backgrounds.","title":"Customization"},{"location":"settings/customization/#customization-settings","text":"","title":"Customization Settings"},{"location":"settings/customization/#application-name","text":"This will replace most references to the word Ombi with a new name.
