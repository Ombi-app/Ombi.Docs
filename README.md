# Ombi.Docs

This is the source repository for the upcoming Ombi Docs site. The intent is to replace the aging wiki with something a little more... professional.
It is very much a work in progress at this point.

The site is being built using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), which converts standard markdown to static html.  
The site layout is configured using markup, held in the `mkdocs.yml` file in the root directory here.  
This language _is_ indent sensitive, so the new documentation repository is not going to be directly publicly editable - all edit requests will need to be approved by [submitting a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/articles/creating-a-pull-request).
