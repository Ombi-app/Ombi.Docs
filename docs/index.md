# Welcome to the Ombi wiki

Please note the wiki is maintained by TidusJar and the community.  

The wiki is built using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org).

## Project layout

    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file for the site itself.
    docs/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.

### Old files below

Any files that get edited are to be removed from the below list and added under their relevant heading inside `mkdocs.yml`, to ensure we avoid double-handling.  
Please ensure that any time you wish to work on the site you do a `git pull` to be sure you're working on the most up-to-date version of the site.
