# Landing Page

You can have a landing page appear before users get to the login page.  
This is useful if you wish to have messages or disclaimers displayed before they make requests.

## Enable

Check this if you want the landing page to be enabled before the login page

## Notice Message

This is an optional message you can put on the landing page.  
It supports full HTML formatting (italics, bold, strikethrough, linking, etc).  
You do _not_ need to declare the doctype in this field, as it is rendered into the Ombi UI directly (which already declares it).
