# Failed Requests

Any requests that fail to be pushed to your download manager (*arr, sickrage, etc) end up here.  
It'll tell you what the request is, what type of content it is, how many times it's retried it, and why it failed.  
It will also allow you to remove it the request if you decide you'd rather just ignore it.
