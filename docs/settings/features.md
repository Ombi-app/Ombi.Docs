## Movie4KRequests

This toggle enables the option of adding a second instance of [Radarr](../all-the-arrs/#radarr-specific) to your config.  
This is intended for people downloading in multiple resolutions (SD/HD & 4K), but can be adapted to suit your requirements.  

## OldTrendingSource

Use the old data source for trending content.  
This will likely be deprecated at some stage.  

## PlayedSync

This is currently an _Emby Only_ feature.  
It allows Ombi to identify whether content requested by a user has actually been played/watched by that user.
