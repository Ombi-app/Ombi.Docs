# Mobile Notifications

This page lets you control notifications for app users.

## Manual Notification

Anyone who uses the Ombi app and is logged in to your instance of Ombi will appear in the list of users on this page.  
Toggle the switch next to the ones you wish to send a notification to, enter the message, and push "Send Notification" to send a custom message to them via the Ombi app.

## Messages

Down the right-hand side of the page you'll find a list of the different notification types.  
Expanding each one will allow you to customise the message for each type.

You can include [notification variables](../../info/notification-template-variables) in these messages for Ombi to auto-fill with.  

_Be sure to hit "Submit" after you edit the messages for the changes to be saved._
