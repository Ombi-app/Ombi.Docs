Here we can configure Ombi to use watchlists from DogNzb.  
_Yes, we know this is in the Nav twice. It's in two places in the settings - note that the Nav matches the order pages appear in the settings._  

## Enabled

Turn on to activate use of DogNzb.

## Api Key

Enter the API key from your DogNzb account.

## Movies

If enabled then any movie requests will be added to your Movie Watchlist on DogNzb.

## Tv Shows

If enabled then any TV requests will be added to your Watchlist on DogNzb.  
Please note that DogNzb does not support episode requests, any sort of TV request will just be added to the Watchlist and that is all.
