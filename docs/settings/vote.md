# Vote

## Enable

Switch on for user requests to auto-approve once enough users vote that they also want that item.

## Vote Limits

Vote limits tell Ombi how many votes the request needs before approval.  
e.g. If the Movie vote limit is 10, it requires 10 Upvotes from 10 different users before it will be approved.

If you set your vote limit to 1 then things will be auto approved!
When a user requests content they are automatically vote number 1.

## Other

If a user upvotes a request, that user will also automatically be subscribed to that request.  
This means they will also be notified when the request becomes available.
