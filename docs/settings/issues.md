# Issue Settings

 --8<-- "assets/glossary.md"

This function is used to allow users to report issues with specific items in your libraries.  

## Enable

Allow users to see the Report Issue button.  

## Enable in progress state

This allows you to mark issues as 'in progress' so users know you're looking into it.

## Delete issues after they have been resolved

Exactly what it says. Deletes an issue 'x' days after you've marked it as resolved.  
Define the number of days in the box below the switch.

## Categories

Be sure to add Categories.  
These are shown as a drop down when users select the Report Issue button.  
We suggest things like:  

- Low Quality
- Hardcoded subtitles
- Missing foreign subtitles
- Wrong language
- Incomplete video
- Incorrect movie
