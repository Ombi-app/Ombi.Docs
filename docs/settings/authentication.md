# Authentication Settings

## Allow users to login without a password

This does exactly what it says on the tin.  
It will allow a user to login with their username, and only their username.
The user must still exist in Ombi.  
If the user has PowerUser or Admin permissions then they also require a password

## Enable Plex OAuth

This allows the user to login using their Plex account.  
A new popup will appear going to Plex.tv asking them to login. Once logged in they will then be able to access Ombi.
