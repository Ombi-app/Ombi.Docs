## Email Provider Specific

If an issue was specific to a certain provider, it'll be noted here.

### Gmail - Less Secure Apps

For SMTP in the past, Gmail required you to enable "access for less secure apps", under your account security. [https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps).  
This setting has been almost completely retired (it's being done in stages, not all users encountered this at once).  
The only way moving forward is via [Two Factor Authentication (2FA)](../../settings/notifications/email/#two-factor-authentication).
