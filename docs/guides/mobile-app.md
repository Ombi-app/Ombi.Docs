# Mobile App

Note: Please stop asking for an iOS app.  
We had one. Apple removed it.  
We appealed/argued it, and Apple stood by their decision to not allow it in the App Store.  
Users are more than welcome to create their own apps, however future versions of Ombi are being written to look beautiful in mobile browsers regardless - rendering lack of app almost moot.  

## Preparation

### Application URL

You can find this in the [Customization Settings](../../settings/customization/#application-url).  
Make sure the application url is set to your externally accessible domain for Ombi.  
e.g. the demo site uses `https://demo.ombi.io/`  

A good idea is to set this up using a [Reverse Proxy](../reverse-proxy), rather than simply forwarding a port.
