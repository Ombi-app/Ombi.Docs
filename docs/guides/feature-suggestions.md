## Where do I submit feature requests?

If you'd like to suggest a new feature for Ombi, this can be done over at [Feature Suggestions](https://features.ombi.io).  
We are well aware that we can't think of everything, and the best place to get actual _useful_ ideas is you, the users.  

## Before you submit a suggestion

Before you submit your idea, please be sure to see if the idea has already been suggested.  
Existing suggestions can be voted for - the more votes an idea gets, the more likely we are to implement it!  
Submitting duplicate requests makes it harder for us to count up how popular an idea is, so again - check first.  
If it isn't already there, then absolutely submit your idea!
