## Vote Limits

Vote limits tell Ombi how many votes the request needs before approval.  
e.g. If the Movie vote limit is 10, it requires 10 Upvotes from 10 different users before it will be approved.

If you set your vote limit to 1 then things will also be auto approved!
When a user requests content it automatically set's a +1 vote for that user.


## Other
If a user upvotes a request then that user will automatically be subscribed to that request and will be notified when the request becomes available.
