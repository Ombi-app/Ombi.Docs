Please stop asking for an iOS app.<br>
We had one. Apple removed it.<br>
We appealed/argued it, and Apple stood by their decision to not allow it in the App Store.<br>
Users are more than welcome to create their own apps, however future versions of Ombi are being written to look beautiful in mobile browsers regardless - rendering lack of app almost moot.<br>

# Setup

### Application URL
You can find this in the [Customization Settings](https://github.com/tidusjar/Ombi/wiki/Customization-Settings#application-url).  
Make sure your application url is set to your externally accessible domain for Ombi. e.g. the demo site uses `https://demo.ombi.io/`<br>
A good idea is to set this up using a [Reverse Proxy](https://github.com/tidusjar/Ombi/wiki/Reverse-Proxy-Examples), rather than simply forwarding a port.

# Connecting
